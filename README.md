## Hi, welcome to my project Ste's Game Reviews - a basic app for reviewing games!

This is the Front end to my project where users can post reviews about games, interact with the reviews by up voting or down voting them and by creating and deleting their own comments on reviews. The site is a single page appication built using React 18.2.0, React-router-dom v6.

Heres a link to the Back-end of this project: [https://https://github.com/TrustTheProcess712/My-BE-NC-Games-Project]

## To Run The App Locally

Clone the repo and cd to stes-fe-nc-games. Open your terminal type pwd and make sure you are in the root directory (stes-fe-nc-games). Run the command npm install to install the relevent dependencies. Then run the script npm start Which runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser, the App is best viewed in mobile view in said browser!
